          <p className="mb-4">
            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make
            websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to
            the owners of the site. Cookies allow websites to remember your
            actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and
            other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don&apos;t
            have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or
            browse from one page to another.

            Types of Cookies We Use
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            We use different types of cookies for various reasons:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These cookies are essential for the operation of our website and
            enable you to use its features. Without these cookies, services you
            have asked for such as secure login, shopping carts, and electronic
            billing cannot be provided. These cookies don&apos;t collect
            information about you that could be used for marketing or
            remembering where you&apos;ve been on the internet.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
            Performance and Analytics Cookies
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These cookies collect information about how visitors use our
            website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often and if
            they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don&apos;t
            collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these
            cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only
            used to improve how our website works.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
            Functionality Cookies
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such
            as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide
            enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be
            able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by
            storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located.
            These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to
            text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can
            customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked
            for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The
            information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot
            track your browsing activity on other websites.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
            Targeting/Advertising Cookies
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8">
            These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more
            relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
            number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
            effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They are usually placed by
            advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you
            have visited a website and this information is shared with other
            organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or
            advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by
            the other organisation.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Third-Party Cookies</h2>

          <p className="mb-8">
            In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party
            cookies to report usage statistics of the Services, deliver
            advertisements on and through the Services, and so on. These cookies
